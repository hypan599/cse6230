This project shows an attempt to return that work complexity from $O(n^2)$ back down to $O(n)$ or thereabouts.\n",

So rapidly, that it is not a terrible approximation to assign to each particle an effective **radius $r$**.  If two particles are not touching (that is if their centers are more than $2r$ apart), then the interactions can safely be ignored (particularly if it will be drowned out relative to the background *Brownian* noise that we saw last week).  In side of $2r$, then the overlapping particles start pushing each other apart.\n",

Suppose the volume of the periodic domain is $V_D$, and there are $N_p$ particles.  Then if the other $N_p - 1$ particles are distributed at random, then we expect $V_p (N_p - 1)/ V_D$ of those particles to interact with the particle in question.

    "\n",
    "- **My experience in the past:** Detailed git histories are correlated with better performance!\n",
    "- **Understand your code before you try to change it:**\n",
    "    - In addition to profiling utilities, it might be useful to add timers to\n",
    "      individual routines.  The division of the program into objects that control\n",
    "      different aspects of the code should make easy to, say, add a timer\n",
    "      in one place without changing the whole program.\n",
    "- **Simple problem parameters that can be changed:**\n",
    "    - The number of boxes per dimension\n",
    "    - The layout of vectors (array-of-structures or structure of arrays? see `vector.h`)\n",
    "    - The data structures used to assign particles to boxes (is a linked-list really best)?\n",
    "- **Avoid memory and other resource contention:**\n",
    "    - Anytime multiple threads are trying to write to locations close to each\n",
    "      other, it makes it difficult and expensive to make sure each thread has\n",
    "      an up-to-date copy of the memory that is changing.  This would happen,\n",
    "      for example, if many threads are writing to the `pairs` list in\n",
    "      the interactions routine.  Consider allocating a separate workspace for\n",
    "      each thread by, for example, giving each thread its own `pairs` array.\n",
    "      Then, once all threads are done computing their pairs, you can combine\n",
    "      the separate arrays into one array, or even change the interface of the\n",
    "      `interactions()` function so that it is multiple lists are returned.\n",
    "- **Find ways to avoid recomputing from scratch:**\n",
    "    - Can you use the layout of the particles from the last time step to help you\n",
    "      bin or find pairs in the next time step?\n",
    "- **You get to choose how many threads we use to evaluate your code:**\n",
    "    - There's nothing inherently wrong with achieving your best performance\n",
    "      using fewer than the maximum number of threads available on a node.  The\n",
    "      problem may simply not have enough concurrency to support every thread.\n",
